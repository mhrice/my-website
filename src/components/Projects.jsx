    It is based on a previous project by Boris Smus
    (Click <a className="home-link" href="https://github.com/borismus/spectrogram">here</a> for his project).
    The project has a ton of controls, including changing the limits of the graph. You can also draw on it with your mouse or finger,
    creating a sine wave at the touched frequency. Furthermore, there are options to
    change the timbre of the sound as well as snap the drawn frequencies to a specific scale.
    You can view a demo of the project&nbsp;

    I'm also currently working on a Web Audio-based oscilloscope.</div>,

    the Aquarium they were able to scan their card and see additional content\

    MIDI data. I then created my own synth to 'jam' on top of the original voices.\
    Next I constructed a drum sequencer, and for the live performace, I 'sang' in\
    beatbox style drums and programed the drums to hit on different beats of\
    each measure. I also produced audio effects to layer at various points\
    including filtering, tremolo, and flanger as well as an eq. Finally, I\
    mapped all of the controls to my Novation LaunchKey 49 and performed my\
    jam with an annotated score.`,

    with the a condenser mic (AT2020), as well as an EIE Pro Audio Interface
    and a pair of Rockit KRK 8's. The genre is acoustic. For the most of the
    tracks, there were only two inputs, Brian's guitar and his vocals, except
    for the last track which featured Chris Mukiibi with extra vocals.
    Overall it was super fun to produce this album and I'm looking forward to
    collaborating more with Brian.
